/*3.2. Sequence Information Matching
At this stage, sequence information matching consists of two parts: one is B sequence matching, and the other is lowercase character information matching. B sequence matching is based on the reference B sequence to find matching segments in the to-be-compressed B sequence. If more than one sequences are to be compressed, HRCM employs the second-level matching automatically among the to-be-compressed sequences. The matching strategy of HRCM is selecting the longest match based on separate chaining.*/

/*
3.2.1. First-Level Matching

In the first step, we create the hash table for reference B sequence. This manuscript creates the hash table based on k-mer, that is, k-mer hashing. It is just like a sliding window with slides of length k over the reference sequence and a window containing a k-mer. We digitally encode the A, C, G, T to 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. In this way, the k-mer is converted into an integer sequence. Then we calculate the hash value of the k-mer. The calculation method assures that different k-mer hash values represent different k-mers. HRCM uses array H and array L to store the positions of all k-mers. All initial values of H are âˆ’1. If the hash value of the i-th k-mer is expressed as , at the stage of hash table creating, i will be stored in the -th element of the array H, and the original value of the -th element in the array H will be stored into the array L. The equation can be expressed as , . Thus, when an identical k-mer appears in the reference sequence, it will be stored in the array H if it is the last one, and otherwise, it will be stored in the array L. After calculating a k-mer hashing, the sliding window slides forward one base character until the window cannot slide anymore. Thus, the hash table builds all k-mer indexes of the reference B sequence.

 is calculated by the same formula for the to-be-compressed B sequence, and then the array H is checked to see if the value exists or not. If it does not exist, it means that the k-mer does not exist in the reference sequence, and the base is recorded as a mismatched character; otherwise, it indicates that the k-mer exists, and then searches will traverse all identical k-mers based on the chain constituted by the array H and the array L. The longest matching segment will be found, the length of the segment is taken as the length value, and the position of the segment in the reference B sequence is used as the position value. The matched segment is represented as a (position, length) tuple and the to-be-compressed segment is replaced.
